        <h2>Why I prefer Dogs over Cats!</h2>
        <p>Dogs are better than Cats, because they are social! They are social animals that depend on you, and are known as "A Man's Best Friend!" How cool is a name like that! Another reason why Dogs are better than Cats is their Nature. When you try to play with a Cat, they just are very boring and sometimes even aggresive, but with Dogs, It's a whole different story. Dogs are miles more playful and active than Cats, and that's probably what you want from an animal. If you got a Cat, they would just lie around and do nothing really playful, but Dogs would help to cheer up your day if you're feeling lonely!</p>
